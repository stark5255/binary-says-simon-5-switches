# binary-says-simon-5-switches
The Simon game is a memory game where players repeat sequences of colors or sounds. In a binary-based Simon, the game could use "on" (1) and "off" (0) light patterns instead, challenging players to remember binary sequences. This version would mimic binary code, offering a unique way to practice memory and understand binary language interactively.
